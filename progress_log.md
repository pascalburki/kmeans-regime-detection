Learned K-means conceptually: clusters, centroids, distance
Worked through distance calculations and centroid updates by hand on toy points
Key finding: K-means works by grouping points together based on their distance 
to the nearest centroid. Each point gets assigned to whichever centroid is 
closest, then the centroid moves to the center of its group, and this process 
repeats until the centroids don't move anymore.

Set up new repo: kmeans-regime-detection
Pulled SPY price data 2018-2023
Computed log returns and 20-day rolling volatility
Key finding: my input features are daily returns and rolling 20 day volatility. returns show the direction and size of price moves, and volatility shows how calm or chaotic
the period was, together they can help us see regimes
